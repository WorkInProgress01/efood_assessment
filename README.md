# efood_assessment
Hi ! Thank you for exploring my code. I hope it's easy to read and the comments are helpful.
In folder PartII you will find the two python files for the second part of the assessment. 
RFM_Squarify.py requires two .csv files to run. I have commended the pd.to_csv functions to get those in lines 166 and 186 of the efood_PartII.py file.
I have attached the csv files in the email as well.
Feel free to use what you feel more comfortable with.
